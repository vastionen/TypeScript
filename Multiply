This is an intro mission, the purpose of which is to explain how to solve missions on CheckiO and how to get the most out of solving them. When the mission is solved, one more station become available for you, containing more complex missions.

So this mission is the easiest one. Write a function that will receive 2 numbers as input and it should return the multiplication of these 2 numbers.

Input: Two arguments. Both are int

Output: Int.

Example:
multTwo(2, 3) == 6
multTwo(1, 0) == 0


function multTwo(a, b) {
    return a*b;
}
