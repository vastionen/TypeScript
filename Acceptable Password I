 You are the beginning of a password series. Every mission will be based on the previous one. Going forward the missions will become slightly more complex.

In this mission you need to create a password verification function.

Those are the verification conditions:

    the length should be bigger than 6.

Input: A string.

Output: A bool.

Example:
isAcceptablePassword('short') == false
isAcceptablePassword('muchlonger') == true
isAcceptablePassword('ashort') == false

Solution:

function isAcceptablePassword(password: string) {
    return password.length>6;
}
